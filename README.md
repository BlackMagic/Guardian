Guardian HTML customisation

This is a short guide to the art of adding HTML tags to your Guardian comments to make them more professional.

HTML tags are used for a variety of functions on a web page. The functions include: making text bold so that it stands out from surrounding text, underlining text, putting text in italics when quoting a source, and providing external links to an article that you want your comment to reference for additional or supporting information.

Some of this functionality is already available in Guardian-provided functions, but generally the Guardian functions result in lack of control and inferior representation of the intended end-result. This is particularly true when inserting external links into Guardian comments.

Let us begin...

HTML tags come in matching pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. Text of your choosing is inserted between the tags, and will be formatted accordingly by the browser that renders the comment on the Guardian website.  

This article considers a limited subset of all HTML tags. Why? One reason is that you will only need to use a handful of HTML tags to get superior Gaurdian comments; the other reason is that the Guardian web browser will ignore HTML tags that might cause unpredictable or unsupported browser results.
