This is a short guide to the art of adding HTML tags to your Guardian comments to make them look more professional.

HTML tags are used for a variety of functions on a web page. The functions include: making text **bold** so that it stands out from surrounding text, underlining selected text, putting text *in italics* when quoting a source, and providing external links to an article that you want your comment to reference for additional or supporting information.

Some of this functionality is already available in Guardian-provided functions, but generally the Guardian functions result in lack of control and inferior representation of the intended end-result. This is particularly true when inserting external links into Guardian comments.

Let us begin...

HTML tags come in matching pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. Text of your choosing is inserted between the tags, and will be formatted accordingly by the browser that renders the comment on the Guardian website.  

This article considers a limited subset of all HTML tags. Why? One reason is that you will only need to use a handful of HTML tags to get superior Gaurdian comments; the other reason is that the Guardian web browser will ignore HTML tags that might cause unpredictable or unsupported browser results.

Opening HTML tags consist of the character '<', a single-character tag identifier, and the terminating character '>'. Examples are: <i>, <b>, <a>, etc. 
  
Closing HTML tags consist of the character '<' followed by the character '/', a single-character tag identifier, and the terminating character '>'. Examples are: </i>, </b>, </a>, etc. 

Opening and closing tags must be matched pairs, ie, every opening tag must be matched by a closing tag following it somewhere in the user-supplied text. For example: <i>Hello World!</i> is a matched pair that the browser will display as <i>Hello World!</i>.
